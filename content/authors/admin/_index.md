"Look for a clearing in the forest, young man. Not a hidden city."

Though he likes to think of himself as largely a flâneur, Joshua Soboil's main shtick is Health Economics. He currently resides in Cape Town, though he intends to leave for London in the next two years. His interests include decision-modelling and philosophy, and he occasionally sneaks out for long walks in the mountains.
