Dear, reader - this is my very first post. I hope to stay up-to-date here with new things I have learnt, including tricks I learn with R. In fact, I think I am going to write a brief markdown file on the distinctions between Monte Carlo and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for PSA methods in health economics sometime soon - don't hold your breath though. 

Sincerely
J Soboil
