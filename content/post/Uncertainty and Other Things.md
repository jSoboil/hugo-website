title: "Uncertainty and Other Stories"

Though one can't always be too sure, at the time of writing, it seems Biden has won the US election. Trumps betting price is sitting around â‰ˆ -60% on [ftx](https://ftx.com/trade/TRUMP). Let's see what happens.

If Biden is elected,I hope that he doesn't maintain the general status-quo that resulted in Trump's presidency and *actually* changes some things. The fact that it is so close shows how Trump speaks to a large part of the US population. Whether one agrees with them or not is besides the point.

So, I guess what I am trying to say is that election forecasting is a _funny_ thing, really. So many of the leading election pollsters, like 538, were predicting a landslide. Such a thing didn't happen. 70 million people still voted for Trump, even after all the incompetence with COVID. 

I mean, there is so much uncertainty in these events - and this is even more heightened by the prolific bot networks in the contemporary digital age. And, like Brexit, I'm pretty sure most of the surveys leading up to the election hardly ever reach the voters that matter - the people who are obviously disillusioned by politics. I mean, check out the first [2 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbWfZOBi4O4&t=710s) of this video for instance. And on the topic of perception management, here's a paper on bots [example](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03034-5). 

I have, however, also been presented with an alternative, which is to keep an eye on the betting markets for this sort of stuff. [Harry Crane](https://twitter.com/HarryDCrane) has some interesting tings to say on his twitter regarding election forecasts.

Anyway, to end, I know, dear reader, that I promised a more technical post. This will have to wait for when I have a bit more time. Generally though, my HPV model is close to completion and I'm now hashing out the last sections of my lit. review.

Sincerely
J.S.
