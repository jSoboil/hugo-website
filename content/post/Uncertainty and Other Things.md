Though one can't always be too sure,, at the time of writing , it seems Biden has the US election. Trumps betting price is sitting around â‰ˆ -60% on [ftx](https://ftx.com/trade/TRUMP). Anyway, let's see what happens.

If Biden is elected,I hope that he doesn't maintain the general status-quo that resulted in Trump's presidency and actually changes some things. The fact that it is so close shows how Trump speaks to a large part of the US population. Whether one agrees with them or not is besides the point.

So, I guess what I am trying to say is that election forecasting is a funny thing. So many of the leading election pollsters, like 538, were predicting a landslide. There is so much uncertainty in these events - I mean, this is even more heightened by the prolific bot networks in the contemporary digital age. And, like Brexit, I'm pretty sure most of the surveys leading up to the election hardly ever reach the voters that matter - the people who are angry and disillusioned by politics. I find it quite frightening how little one can trust social media - see for [example](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03034-5). Anyway, I've found it much more exciting to monitor the betting markets for this sort of stuff, while [Harry Crane](https://twitter.com/HarryDCrane) has some interesting stuff to say on his twitter regarding election forecasts.

Anyway, I know dear reader that I promised a more technical post. This will have to wait for when I have a bit more time. Generally though, my HPV model is close to completion, and I'm now hashing out the last sections of my lit. review.

Sincerely
J.S.
